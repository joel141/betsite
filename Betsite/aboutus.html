                    I started betting far back when betting was known as Pool, but in 2010, a friend of mine took me to
                    a betting shop where we spent some hours and I was patiently waiting while he was busy with a
                    Computer and Cartoon football. So when we were out, I asked "What was that thing you were doing",
                    and he said "I went to bet on virtual football",l was caim because, I don't understand what he meant
                    with the word virtual football. But after some days I went to him for more information and at the
                    end of the discussion, I asked him how much he had made from the betting things and he said "Bros
                    virtual football dey burn money like fire no near there ooo.
                    "BUT SOME PEOPLE THE MAKE AM BUT I NEVER MAKE ANYTHING".
                    During the discussion I heard him said it was a computer programmed football, those things I was
                    seeing were cartoons. Since then I picked interest and have being betting and learning virtual
                    football with good and bad online and scammers.
                    I had a lot of online and offline training handouts because I was seeking for the truth and finally
                    someone showed up and show me a way. So my friend, someone must show you a way.
                    Virtual Football has put smile on my face and I have made Millions from it.
                    I quit my job because l work less hours with three times of my salary every month.
                    I am not answerable to any Boss or Manager. I enter trade at anytime that pleases me right from my
                    house.
                    Virtual football is unique and sweet especially when it comes to business setup and it has to do
                    with planning, target, determination and focus.
